# It's Dangerous to Come Along
Rimworld "It's Dangerous to Come Along" mod

"Fido. Fido! Stay, boy. Stay. Stay! Fido, stay! No, over there. By the corn. Go! Go to the corn! Okay. Hold on. Okay. Come here, Fido. Come here. Now . . . Stay! Stay! No, stop! Ack! No licking! Fido! Sit! Stay! Sit! Dammit, Fido!"

"Zoya?"

"Yeah, Chef?"

"What are you doing?"

"I'm tryin' to get Fido to stay here. It's too dangerous out there, fighting that infestation. Fido'll get hurt."

"I can just assign him away from you."

"But . . . Fido! He's mah animal! I can't leave him, I'll go berserk, and the fire spirits will start talkin' to me again!"

"Okay. Yes. That would be bad. But it's just for a few minutes. That'll be okay, right?"

". . . Yeah. Ah guess. Just don't forget, okay?"

"Okay. I promise."

"Good."

"Oh, and, uh, Zoya?"

"Yeah?"

"Why did you name a camel 'Fido'?"

I got annoyed at pets following drafted pawns around. This is almost never the thing I want, so I kept unassigning pets, then reassigning them, and it was a huge pain.

This mod makes it so that pets will no longer follow drafted pawns. In an attempt to preserve the behavior where pets will protect their masters from kidnapping, they *will* head over to their master if they're downed, for whatever reason.

This has the unintended side effect that characters undergoing surgery will be surrounded by their pets until they wake up.

Unintended, but hilarious, and kind of cute.

I left it in.
